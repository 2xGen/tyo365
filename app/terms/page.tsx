                <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Tyo365 is an informational and affiliate website that helps visitors discover and compare tours and
                  experiences in Tokyo. We are owned and operated by 2xGen LLC. We do not offer user accounts or sign-up
                  functionality. We do not collect or process your personal information for account purposes.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">2. We do not handle bookings</h2>
                <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  All tours and experiences shown on Tyo365 are offered by third-party operators. When you choose to
                  book, you are redirected to our affiliate partner Viator (or the relevant operator’s booking channel).
                  We do not process, store, or handle any bookings ourselves. Any booking you make is subject to the
                  terms and policies of the booking provider (e.g. Viator and the tour operator).

                <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  We are an official Viator affiliate partner. The tours displayed on Tyo365 are sourced from Viator’s
                  catalogue. We may earn a commission when you book through links on our site, at no extra cost to you.
                  This does not affect how we present or recommend tours. Our affiliate status does not make us the
                  seller or provider of any tour; the contract for the experience is between you and the operator or
                  Viator.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-3">4. No liability for tours or experiences</h2>
                <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                  We are not a tour operator and do not run any tours or experiences. We are not responsible for: the
                  quality, safety, or conduct of any tour or activity; any injury, loss, or damage you may suffer
                  during or in connection with a tour; cancellations, no-shows, or changes made by operators or Viator;
                  or any disputes between you and the operator or booking provider. All such matters are solely between
                  you and the relevant operator or Viator. We encourage you to read the operator’s and Viator’s terms
                  and cancellation policies before booking.
